# Welcome to My Journey!

Hi, I'm Sean (@MillerTekWorks). I am a dedicated professional on a self-directed career transition into **AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics**. This repository is the headquarters for my journey, documenting each project as I build the practical skills to engineer the next generation of intelligent machines. With a passion for robotics and drones, I believe in learning by doing, and the projects you'll find here reflect that philosophy.

### What I'm Focused On Now

I am currently building deep foundational skills as part of **Phase 1** of my technical roadmap:

* **Programming:** Mastering **Python** fundamentals, next is engineering applications and learning data science libraries such as (**NumPy, Pandas**). And some **JS/Node**.
* **Mathematics for ML:** Right now I'm filling in the gaps so I can move on to learn **Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Statistics**.
* **Core Technologies:** Building fluency in **Git/GitHub**. Soon I'll dive into foundational **C++** for high-performance code, and **Linux** beyond just the basics. 

### My Tech Toolbox (work in progress)

*(This toolbox will grow as I progress through my learning plan to include PyTorch, ROS, and more.)*

### :robot: The Goal

Short term goal is to get my foot in the door somewhere at the intersection of AI/ML/Robotics. My long-term focus is on contributing to ambitious projects in the **humanoid robotics** or **defense technology** sectors. I am open to collaboration on projects that align with these interests and offer opportunities for growth.

### :fountain_pen: Let's Connect

I'm always open to networking with fellow developers, engineers, and mentors. The best way to connect is via my LinkedIn profile.
